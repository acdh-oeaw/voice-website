summary: Access for information on the POS tagging and lemmatization of VOICE.
---
Along with publishing the part-of-speech tagged and lemmatized versions of VOICE, we regard it as essential to provide a detailed documentation of the guiding principles and decisions which have been taken in the process. Such a documentation is especially important with regard to the data at hand, as it often had to be dealt with in novel and unprecedented ways because of its spoken and variable nature. It is, therefore, highly recommended to users of VOICE to familiarize themselves with this manual when working with the POS tags in VOICE 3.0 Online.
