VOICE 3.0 Online includes all search functions of the previous VOICE web interfaces. Additionally, **new query options** make it possible for VOICE users to search for select mark-up features for spoken language (e.g. pauses, laughter, overlaps, etc.). The new VOICE 3.0 interface merges the regular VOICE Online interface with the VOICE POS Online interface. This means that lexical searches and novel searches for conversational mark-up are possible in combination with annotated POS and lemma tags in the same web interface.
